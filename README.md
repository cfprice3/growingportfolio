For this project we were told to build a bio/portfolio/contact webpage utilizing bootstrap.
An important requirement was to make sure that the page content including images were responsive
to breaks due to screen sizing.  This is important depending on the device being used to view the site,
as cell phones, tablets, and laptops/PCs all have different screen sizes and can see the content differently.  The idea of a responsive site is to make it flow and look great, no matter the size of the screen.

I did use a reset.css file in order to clear any browser settings.  Luckily, I did not have to use any additional media queries in my style.css file to adjust for screen downsizing, as the coding I used from bootstrap took care of any issues I might have.

We were also encouraged to take advantage of bootstrap's grid layout and utilize rows and columns to design the look of our pages.  I used containers, rows, and columns on each html page to get the desired effect.  Much easier than using float.

I did take the liberty to adjust and change some of the bootstrap code to give it the look I wanted.  This took a lot of trial and error, time, and just guessing to see what worked and what didn't.  However, It was a lot of fun and helped me understand and appreciate the code a little better.

One issue I ran into was that I could not get the "hamburger" style menu to drop down my link options in navbar.  I would click the icon and nothing would happen.  After utilizing Slack to ask questions to the class, a class mate brought my attention to a few more style sheet links needed from bootstrap in order to get the coding to work properly.  After adding those links, my navbar was fixed.

As a bonus, we were encouraged to add a sticky footer to the page.  I was able to obtain  this using a simple text navbar code from bootstrap.

Overall, this project took a while to get everything working and looking just how I wanted it to, but it was challenging in a good way.  I enjoyed playing with different properties to customize every little bit of my pages.
